### Patient Scheduling in an Urgency Room (Part 1)

Efficient patient scheduling in an urgency room may lead to a life or death situation. The
situation is even more critical in pandemic times, like the ones we leave today, in which the
numbers of patients may increase significantly. Depending on a given number of patients in
the waiting room and doctors in service, the goal is to minimize the patient waiting time
for a consult. A critical component is how we should handle the different seriousness levels
that each patient has. As standard in every urgency room, patients are labeled depending
on their needs (maximum waiting time and the duration of the consults), usually with color
bracelets. This project aims at addressing this problem of finding the patient/medical doctor
association schedule, from now called the PMDA problem.

### Medical Diagnosis (Part 2)

Medical diagnosis is the process of identifying the underlying cause of a set of symptoms.
It is a critical step for determining the right treatment for the patients. It involves not
only the patient’s symptoms but also tests/exams obtained for identifying specific diseases.
This mini-project aims at providing the medical doctors a tool for helping in the patients’
diagnosis. It will take into account the symptoms, the possible diseases, and the uncertainty
associated with the evidence (tests and exams).The goal of this project is to determine the 
most probable disease that the patient has, as well as its probability value.
